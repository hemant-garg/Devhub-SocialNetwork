# DEVHUB - SocialNetwork for Developers

Hey there, I've created this beautiful looking project from complete scratch using MERN stack(mongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).

**Check out the website here -** https://devhub2.herokuapp.com/

( This project is the outcome of the course "MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js" by Brad Traversy. Great course ;) )

## Main features of this Website

> Simple yet beautiful UI.

> Login/Signup using jwt and passport.

> Create/Modify your Profile.

> News Feed page.

> Can Like/Unlike or comment on any post.

> View any user's profile page.

> Show five recent github repositories of the user (if present).

> Have Private Routes so that only LoggedIn user can access the pages.
